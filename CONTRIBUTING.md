# Contributing to VinPN

Thanks for helping! Issues and pull requests are welcome in English or Vietnamese.

## Reporting bugs

Please include:

- Your Windows version and VinPN version.
- What you did, what you expected, and what happened.
- The log: **Advanced → Logs → save file**. Logs never contain visited domains, but check them before posting.
- If DNS was left wrong, the output of `Get-DnsClientServerAddress`.

## Development setup

See [Building from source](README.md#building-from-source). In short:

```bash
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@v3.0.0-beta.27
cd frontend && npm ci && cd ..
wails3 dev
```

## Pull requests

- **Tests first.** Every behavior change or bug fix comes with a test that fails without it.
- **Keep it green:** `go test ./...`, `cd frontend && npm test`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `golangci-lint run` (CI runs all of them).
- **System changes need extra care.** Code that touches adapter DNS, services or scheduled tasks must keep the safety net intact: snapshot first, and always be able to restore. Run the integration tests in an admin terminal.
- **Translations:** add every new UI string to both `frontend/src/i18n/vi.json` and `en.json`; a parity test checks this.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) (`fix(dpi): …`, `feat(ui): …`) and keep each PR to one topic.

## Things we won't merge

- Telemetry, or anything that writes visited domains to disk.
- Code that stops or kills third-party processes or services without the user's explicit consent.
- Changes to the bundled zapret2 or GoodbyeDPI binaries without updating their pinned hashes and NOTICE.
- Lists, presets, default test sites or docs that target websites or services blocked by a competent authority (for example gambling, piracy, or platforms blocked by government order). VinPN's purpose is privacy and protection against DNS spoofing, not reaching content that is prohibited by law.

## Issues about specific blocked sites

Please don't post issues asking how to reach a specific site or service that is blocked by government order, or share lists of such sites. Those issues will be edited or closed. Describe the network symptom instead (for example "TLS handshake resets on network X") so it can be fixed in a general way.
